        <p>This is the future location for the "Old Smokey" website, managed and updated by the Old Smokey Steering Committee, that will include the history, documentary, news, and events concerning the Old Smokey incinerator that operated in the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami until 1970 and the toxic debris it left behind.
        If you are interested in learning more about Old Smokey before the site launches, watch the <a href="https://vimeo.com/104690626">documentary</a> on Vimeo.</p>
