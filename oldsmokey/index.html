    <h3>Coming Soon</h3>
    <h1>OLD SMOKEY .org</h1>
        <div id = "subscribe"></div>    
        <p>Our site is still under construction and will be up in May 2015. The Old Smokey website, managed and updated by the Old Smokey Steering Committee, will include the history, documentary, news, and events concerning the incinerator, "Old Smokey," that operated in the Coconut Grove neighborhood of Miami until 1970, and the toxic debris it left behind.
        If you are interested in learning more about Old Smokey before the site launches, watch the <a href="https://vimeo.com/104690626">documentary</a> on Vimeo.</p>
